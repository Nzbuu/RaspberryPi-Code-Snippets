RaspberryPi-Code-Snippets
=========================
This repository contains the first small projects I tried out on the raspberry pi. 
It contains scripts to directly change the state of the GPIO pin, 
read the state of the GPIO pin.
It also contains scripts to communicate with the raspberry pi via a server. 
There are two projects for this, one using Bottle, and one using WebIOPi.
